# Sharpe Ratio Analysis for Investment Decisions

This project explores the Sharpe Ratio as a tool for assessing the risk-adjusted returns of different investment opportunities. Specifically, we compare the performance of two technology stocks—Amazon and Facebook—against the S&P 500 index, a standard benchmark for U.S. stocks. This analysis demonstrates how to calculate and interpret the Sharpe Ratio, enabling data-driven investment decisions.

### Introduction to the Sharpe Ratio

Overview of William Sharpe's contribution to finance, including the Sharpe Ratio, a widely used metric for evaluating risk-adjusted returns.
Explanation of how the Sharpe Ratio is applied to measure the performance of Amazon and Facebook stocks against the S&P 500 index.


### Data Preparation

Importing and cleaning stock data for Amazon and Facebook, as well as S&P 500 index data as a benchmark.
Initial data exploration and summary statistics to understand the data's structure and scope.


### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    - Visualization of daily stock prices and the S&P 500 index to identify trends and differences.
    - Calculation of daily returns for each stock and the benchmark index.
    - Plotting daily returns to gain insights into volatility.


### Calculating Excess Returns

Determining excess returns by calculating the difference between daily stock returns and the benchmark's daily returns.
Summarizing and visualizing excess returns as inputs for the Sharpe Ratio.


### Sharpe Ratio Calculation

Calculating the average excess return and standard deviation of the excess return for each stock.
Using these metrics to compute the Sharpe Ratio and annualizing it for meaningful comparison.


### Conclusion and Investment Recommendation

After an interpretation of the Sharpe Ratios for Amazon and Facebook, it is recommended to buy Amazon.
Comparison of risk-adjusted returns has Amazon showing a higher Sharpe Ratio, suggesting a more favorable investment in risk-adjusted terms.

This analysis helps demonstrate how the Sharpe Ratio allows investors to make more informed decisions by accounting for both risk and return, thus enabling a standardized comparison between different investment opportunities.
